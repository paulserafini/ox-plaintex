* ox-plaintex

This is an export backend for Org which provides plain TeX (as opposed to LaTeX) export. It is derived from ox-latex. As yet, it enables the export of:
 - Emphasis and monospace markup (*bold*, /italic/, _underlined_, +strike-through+, =verbatim=, and ~code~)
 - Footnotes
 - Superscripts and subscripts
 - Tables
 - Lists
 - Quote, source, center, and example blocks
Anything else will be exported in LaTeX format.

* Installation

To install ox-plaintex, put ox-plaintex.el in a directory which is included in your ~load path~, then add the following line to your init file:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
(load "ox-plaintex")
(require 'ox-plaintex)
#+END_EXAMPLE
For TeX compilation you may also need to install the [[https://tug.org/eplain/doc/eplain.html][Eplain]] macro package. On Debian and Ubuntu, Eplain is part of the "texlive-formats-extra" package.
