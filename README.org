* ox-tex

This is an export backend for Org which provides plain TeX (as opposed to LaTeX) export. It is derived from ox-latex.

* Installation

To install ox-tex, put ox-tex.el in a directory which is included in your ~load path~, then add the following line to your init file:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
(require "ox-tex")
#+END_EXAMPLE
For TeX compilation you may also need to install the [[https://tug.org/eplain/doc/eplain.html][Eplain]] macro package. On Debian and Ubuntu, Eplain is part of the "texlive-formats-extra" package.

* Features

Since ox-tex is intended for writing, many of Org's features are not supported. Here I'll give an overview of what you /can/ do.

** Preamble

In the preamble of your document you may define the following:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  ,#+TEX_CLASS: article
  ,#+MACROS: macros.tex
  ,#+TITLE: Example Title
  ,#+AUTHOR: Your Name
  ,#+ABSTRACT: A condensed summary
  ,#+KEYWORDS: org-mode, TeX
#+END_EXAMPLE

There are two document "classes", book and article. If a local file isn't defined using ~#+MACROS~, then the .tex file corresponding to ~#+TEX_CLASS~ is downloaded from this github respository and inserted into the preamble of the document. If you specify a local file then class doesn't do anything. Keywords are only included if there is an abstract.

** Table

A table is defined in the usual way:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  ,#+CAPTION: FORTRAN subroutines (Kelton & Law)
  ,#+LABEL: fortran
  |--------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------|
  | Subprogram   | Purpose                                                            |
  |--------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------|
  | INIT         | Initialization routine                                             |
  | TIMING       | Timing routine                                                     |
  | ARRIVE       | Event routine to process type 1 events                             |
  | DEPART       | Event routine to process type 2 events                             |
  | REPORT       | Generates report when simulation ends                              |
  | UPTAVG       | Updates continuous-time area-accuulator statistics                 |
  | \omit        | just before each event occurence                                   |
  | EXPON(RMEAN) | Function to generate an exponential random variate with mean RMEAN |
  | RAND(1)      | Function to generate a uniform random variate between 0 and 1      |
  |--------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------|
#+END_EXAMPLE

# [[./img/fortran.png]]

As in the example, since the strut is in the first column you can continue a previous column by putting \omit in the first column of that row. You would reference this table using ~Table [[fortran]]~.

You can create a matrix by setting 'environment' to matrix:
 
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  ,#+ATTR_LATEX: :mode math :environment matrix
  | 1 | 0 | 0 |
  | 0 | 1 | 0 |
  | 0 | 0 | 1 |
#+END_EXAMPLE

If 'mode' is set to math then the matrix is wrapped in $$. If it's set to in-line math it's wrapped in $. Otherwise it's not wrapped in anything.

** Code blocks

You can include code and its output in a verbatim environment:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  ,#+BEGIN_SRC python :results output :exports both
    for i in range(0, 5):
        print(i)
  ,#+END_SRC
#+END_EXAMPLE

** Example blocks

An example block is also exported to a verbatim environment:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  ,#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    ,,#+BEGIN_QUOTE
    HAMLET:
    Why, look you now, how unworthy a thing you make of
    me! You would play upon me; you would seem to know
    my stops; you would pluck out the heart of my
    mystery; you would sound me from my lowest note to
    the top of my compass: and there is much music,
    excellent voice, in this little organ; yet cannot
    you make it speak. 'Sblood, do you think I am
    easier to be played on than a pipe? Call me what
    instrument you will, though you can fret me, yet you
    cannot play upon me.
    ,,#+END_QUOTE
  ,#+END_EXAMPLE
#+END_EXAMPLE

** Quote blocks

A quote block is exported with indentation on either side (\narrower).

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  ,#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  HAMLET:
  Why, look you now, how unworthy a thing you make of
  me! You would play upon me; you would seem to know
  my stops; you would pluck out the heart of my
  mystery; you would sound me from my lowest note to
  the top of my compass: and there is much music,
  excellent voice, in this little organ; yet cannot
  you make it speak. 'Sblood, do you think I am
  easier to be played on than a pipe? Call me what
  instrument you will, though you can fret me, yet you
  cannot play upon me.
  ,#+END_QUOTE
#+END_EXAMPLE

** Center blocks

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  ,#+BEGIN_CENTER
  center me
  ,#+END_CENTER
#+END_EXAMPLE

** Lists

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
- one
- two
- three
#+END_EXAMPLE

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
1. one
2. two
3. three
#+END_EXAMPLE

** Markup

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
*bold*
/italic/

_underlined_
