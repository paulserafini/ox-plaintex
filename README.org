* ox-plaintex

This is an export backend for Org, which enables plain TeX (as opposed to LaTeX) export. It is derived from ox-latex. As yet, it enables export of:
 - Emphasis/monospace markup (bold, italic, underlined, verbatim, and code)
 - Footnotes
 - Superscripts and subscripts
 - Tables
 - Lists
 - Quote blocks
 - Source blocks
To install it, put ox-plaintex.el in a directory which is included in your ~load path~, then then add the following line to your init file:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
(require 'ox-plaintex)
#+END_EXAMPLE
