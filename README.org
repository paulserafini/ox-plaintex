* ox-plaintex

This is an export backend for Org which provides plain TeX (as opposed to LaTeX) export. It is derived from ox-latex. As yet, it enables the export of:
 - Emphasis and monospace markup (*bold*, /italic/, _underlined_, =verbatim=, and ~code~)
 - Footnotes
 - Superscripts and subscripts
 - Tables
 - Lists
 - Quote blocks
 - Source blocks

* Installation

To install ox-plaintex, put ox-plaintex.el in a directory which is included in your ~load path~, then add the following line to your init file:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
(require 'ox-plaintex)
#+END_EXAMPLE
For TeX compilation you also need to install the [[https://tug.org/eplain/doc/eplain.html][Eplain]] macro package, if you don't have it. On Debian and Ubuntu it is part of the "texlive-formats-extra" package.
